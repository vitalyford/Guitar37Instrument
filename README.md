# Guitar37Instrument

This project simulates the Guitar 37 instrument based on the Karplus-Strong algorithm. It is an assignment that can be used in a Data Structures course teaching about Linked Lists or Ring Buffers.

The Audio and Draw are taken from the [Stanford's libraries](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) and the idea is coming from [Guitar Heroine](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2012/wayne-guitar-heroine/).

The students need to create a new class implementing the Instrument interface and replace the AsianMalaysian in the [PlayInstrument.java](PlayInstrument.java) with their class name.

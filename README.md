# Guitar37Instrument

This project simulates the Guitar 37 instrument based on the Karplus-Strong algorithm. It is an assignment that can be used in a Data Structures course teaching about Linked Lists or Ring Buffers.

The Audio and Draw are taken from the [Stanford's libraries](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) and the idea is coming from [Guitar Heroine](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2012/wayne-guitar-heroine/).

The students need to fill in the missing code in `SuperCoolGuitar.java` implementing the `Instrument` interface and run [`PlayInstrument.java`](src/main/java/PlayInstrument.java) to test their code. When everything works, the students should rename both the `SuperCoolGuitar.java` file and the class inside of the file by replacing it with their first and last names. Afterwards, the students will submit the file. For example, in my case, I would rename the `SuperCoolGuitar.java` file to `VitalyFord.java` and I would rename the class inside of the file to `VitalyFord`.
